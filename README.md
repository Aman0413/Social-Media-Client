# Social Media Web App

## live : https://social-media-client-rk7w.onrender.com

I have developed a full-stack social media web application using the MERN stack. This platform allows users to create an account, post updates, follow other users, and engage with their content through likes and comments.

The front-end of the application was built using React, which provides a responsive and intuitive user interface. Redux was used for state management, allowing for efficient data handling and manipulation.

On the back-end, the application uses a MongoDB database to store user information, posts, and comments. Node.js and Express were used to handle server-side logic, providing a secure and efficient API for client-server communication.

The application's features include user authentication and authorization, CRUD operations for posts and comments, as well as a feed of posts from followed users.
